# üèõÔ∏è Philosophers - The Philosophy of Concurrency

## üìú Description
The **Philosophers** project is a simulation of the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem**. It introduces the management of **threads**, **mutexes**, and **synchronization** in C, covering essential concepts of concurrency and shared resource access.

## üîß Project Rules
- A group of philosophers sits around a table with a bowl of spaghetti.
- Each philosopher can **think**, **eat**, or **sleep**, but never do two actions simultaneously.
- To eat, a philosopher must pick up two forks, but only one fork is available between each pair of philosophers.
- If a philosopher doesn‚Äôt eat within a given time, they will starve, and the simulation ends.
- **Goal**: Coordinate philosophers so they can eat without causing **deadlocks** or **race conditions**.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation
### üîπ Mandatory Part (`philo/`)
- Uses **threads** and **mutexes** to manage forks.
- Must prevent race conditions and deadlocks.
- Strict memory management and error handling.

### ‚ú® Bonus (`philo_bonus/`)
- Uses **processes** instead of threads.
- **Semaphores** replace mutexes for fork management.
- Each philosopher is a separate process.

## üìå Usage
Compile the project with:
```bash
make
```
Run the simulation with:
```bash
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
Example:
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
```
For the bonus version:
```bash
make bonus
./philo_bonus 5 800 200 200
```

## üìÇ Submitted Files
- `Makefile` (with `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re` rules)
- C source files (`*.c, *.h`)
- Directories:
    - `philo/` ‚Üí Thread-based implementation
    - `philo_bonus/` ‚Üí Process & semaphore-based implementation

## üöÄ Key Learnings
‚úÖ Thread and process management  
‚úÖ Synchronization using mutexes and semaphores  
‚úÖ Avoiding race conditions and deadlocks  
‚úÖ Efficient memory management

### üß™ Testing Cases

| Command | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------------|
| `./philo` | ‚ùå Error: wrong number of arguments |
| `./philo 5 800 200 200` | ‚úÖ Valid |
| `./philo 5 800 200 200 -3` | ‚ùå Error: must be > 0 |
| `./philo 3 800 abc 200` | ‚ùå Error: must be numbers |
| `./philo 0 800 200 200` | ‚ùå Error: must be > 0 |
| `./philo 3 800 200 200 3` | ‚úÖ Valid |

### üîç How to Check for Memory Leaks in Your Project

#### üß™ Option 1: Use `valgrind` (the most thorough method)

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./philo 3 800 200 200 3
```

#### üìå Explanation of the flags:

- `--leak-check=full`: shows all memory leaks, even the smallest ones.
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: displays direct, indirect, and other types of leaks.
- You can also add:  
  `--track-origins=yes` to identify the origin of the leak.

---

#### üî• Example of expected output:

```bash
‚ùØ ./philo 5 800 200 200 -3
Error: invalid input(solo integers :(
‚ùØ valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./philo 3 800 200 200 3
